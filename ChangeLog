v2.0
- changed package 'demography' from Imports to Depends in DESCRIPTION file 
- copied 'plot.lca' from package 'demography' and modified it to reflect a change 
  in ftsa::plot.ftsm (ftsa_5.0)
- copied 'print.lca' from package 'demography' to avoid using 'e1071:::print.lca'
- registered 'plot.lca' and 'print.lca' as S3 methods
- a bug fix in 'RuinDialog': parameters U0 and theta failed to pass to 'drawRuin'
- added error messages to functions 'computeRuin' and 'computeRuinFinate' if the user 
  provides a too small initial capital U0  
- shortened some lines in documentation
