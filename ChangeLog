v2.0
- copied 'print.lca' from package 'demography' to avoid using 'e1071:::print.lca'

  provides a too small initial capital U0

- added the functions drawIncidence, drawIncidenceFin, drawBars, drawBarsFin, drawTests,
  drawPositiveRate, plotForecast and plotR to plot various graphs related to an epidemic
